# Chapter 0. Preparation

## Development Machines

**MacOS** is highly recommended. Due to its similarity to Unix/Linux environment, using macOS will enable you to smoothly transfer the development environment to Linux servers, for which we will use in the later of the course.

At the time of writing, the following mac models are recommended:

- (RMB 11,299) **MacBook Air**, 13 inch, M1 chip, 16GB unified memory, 512GB SSD.
- (RMB 14,499) **iMac**, 24 inch, M1 chip, 16GB unified memory, 512GB SSD.
- (RMB  8,299) **Mac mini**, M1 chip, 16GB unified memory, 512GB SSD, *external display required*.

Other models are OK, as well. A general guide line is as follows,

- M1 chip is highly recommended. As of macOS 12 Monterey, chances are that some features will not be supported by Intel chips.
- 16GB memory is required. Indeed, the only reason to choose Intel chip models is that you need more memory, e.g., the 16 inch MacBook Pro gives you options for 32GB/64GB memory. Generally, software development requires large memory.
- MacBook models come with a higher priority, since you need it in class.

Windows machines are not recommended. If you are really a Windows fan, you might have to deal with development environment issues on your own.

## Software and Tools

Download and install the following tools:

- Text Editor: **Visual Studio Code**, *Microsoft*. [Download here ðŸ¤š](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- IDE (integrated development envionrment): **PyCharm Edu**, *JetBrains*. [Download here ðŸ¤š](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/)

We will also need a handy command line tool, as follows,

- For macOS users, [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) is highly recommended.
- For Windows users, [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal) is highly recommended.

> Note that the above tools are only a **terminal emulator**. To make your command line development more comfort, you also need to get a handy **shell software**, for which we will cover later.

Finally, you need a `ç§‘å­¸ä¸Šè›§ã‚§å…·`. For simplicity, I recommend [xiyou360](https://xiyou360.net). If you need a referral code, use my email address: `yuanqili1018@gmail.com`.
